# Seminar lectures (9 credits)

By attending (not necessarily all) the seminar courses and complete their writing assigments/exericses, you get upgrade to 9 credits.

1. **Continuous-time filtering**. <br>
    This lecture is concerned with continuous-time filtering, for example, Zakai equation, Kushner equation, and projection filtering. <br>
    Date: 14 Nov, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström <br>
    Lecturer: [Muhammad Fuady Emzir](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nfBRAHAAAAAJ&hl=en) (KFUPM)

2. **SDEs and Markov chain Monte Carlo**. <br>
    In this lecture, we present a general recipe for constructing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, including stochastic gradient (SG) versions, from stochastic continuous dynamics (SDEs). We also explore the connections between SG-MCMC and stochastic optimization methods via simple annealing techniques. Recommended readings: 1) A Complete Recipe for Stochastic Gradient MCMC. 2) Bridging the gap between stochastic gradient MCMC and stochastic optimization. <br>
    Date: 21 Nov, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström <br>
    Lecturer: [Cagatay Yildiz](https://cagatayyildiz.github.io/) (University of Tübingen)

3. **Probabilistic numerics for ordinary differential equations**. <br>
    Probabilistic numerical methods aim to explicitly represent the numerical uncertainty that results from limited computational resources. In this lecture, we present a class of probabilistic numerical solvers for ODEs which pose the numerical solution of an ODE as a Gauss--Markov regression problem. The resulting methods, called "ODE filters", efficiently compute posterior distributions over ODE solutions with methods from Bayesian filtering and smoothing. <br>
    Date: 25 Nov, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström <br>
    Lecturer: [Nathanael Bosch](https://nathanaelbosch.github.io/) (University of Tübingen)

4. **Applications of SDEs in statistical signal processing**. <br>
    In this lecture we present a few applications that use SDEs to solve signal processing problems. These include, for example, using SDEs to construct non-stationary processes to model complicated signals, and using SDEs to estiamte the spectrogram of signals with uncertainty. <br>
    Date: 28 Nov, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström

5. TBD. <br>
    2 Dec, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström. You are very welcome to contact me if you would like to give a guest lecture.

6. **Constructions of Wiener processes and stochastic integrals**. <br>
    This lecture explains the constructions of Brownian motion and Ito integrals. 
    Date: 5 Dec, 2022. Room 101127 Ångström

Time is 13:15 - 17:00 for all the seminar lectures, but the actual time depends on the lecturers.

Note that the dates for the seminar courses are not fixed. They are subject to change depending on the schedule of the lecturers.

# Course arrangement

The course consists of lectures, exercises, and project work. Specifically, in each week, there would be one/two lectures (45 + 45 mins) and an exercise session (60 mins). The students shall present and discuss their exercise solutions during the exercise session. 

Total credit is 6 or 9.

In order to get 6 credits, you need to 

- actively participate all the essential lectures,
- pass the three exercise assignments,
- present the project work. Depending on the number of students, you may do the project work in group.

If you would like to get 9 credits, you need to fullfill the requirements for the 6 credits as stated above, and in addition, 

- actively participate all the seminar lectures,
- Select five from all the seminar lectures, then pass the exercises of the selected, or do a writing assignment if the lecture has no exercise. (We will define the writing assignment later).

The course grade is based on pass/fail.

# Project work

To be added.

# Reading materials

- Hui-Hsiung Kuo. Introduction to stochastic integration. Universitext. Springer, 2006.
- Simo Särkkä and Arno Solin. Applied stochastic differential equations. Cambridge University Press, 2019.
