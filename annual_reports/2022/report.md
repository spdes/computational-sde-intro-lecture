# Annual report 2022, winter

In this report, we review the feedbacks from the students to evaluate the performance of the course, and consider how to improve the course thereupon.

Please find the student feedbacks provided at `./Ogranskad sammanstallning - kurt80463_ogranskad.pdf`.

We begin with a basic statistics of the course.

# Basic statistics

- **Course name**: A computational introduction to stochastic differential equations
- **Date**: 17 October 2022 to 16 December 2022.
- **Level**: Doctoral level (for IT department, Uppsala University).
- **Credits**: 6 credits. Students can upgrade to 9 credits by doing the exercises of the seminar courses.
- **Number of students**: After of the announcement of the course, around 20 students registered the course. However, there were actually only around 10 active students enrolled in the course. The number of attendees of each lecture is given as follows.

  - Lecture 1: Around 8
  - Lecture 2: Around 10
  - Lecture 3: 12
  - Lecture 4: 12
  - Lecture 5: 8
  - Lecture 6: 7
  - Lecture 7: 7
  - Lecture 8: 8
  - Seminar lectures: forgot to track
  
  There are **10** students passed the course and got **6** credits. Among these 10 students, there are a plenty of them were interested in getting the 9 credits. However, at the end of the course, only **2** students eventually did the seminar exercises and got 9 credits. This is not surprised due to the following reasons: 1) the topics of the seminar courses are very versatile, hence, it can be hard to find a student who is interested in all of them, not to mention to do all their exercises. 2) the assignments for the seminar lectures were not well defined and prepared. 3) one lecture was too technical. 

# Analysis of the course feedbacks

The feedbacks are available at `./Ogranskad sammanstallning - kurt80463_ogranskad.pdf`. There are in total 7 (out of 10) students answered the poll. Compared to other courses from the IT department, for example, Advanced Probabilistic Machine Learning which has only 20% students answered, our answer rate is significantly much higher. We had decent students!

1. **How would you rate the course’s degree of difficulty?** Most students agreed that the course is not too difficult and not too hard either. 
2. **How did you perceive the course’s workload in relation to its size (number of credits)?** Six students agreed that the amount of credits they got and workload are balanced. One student argues that the workload is slightly demanding.
3. **I feel that the treatment of students in the course has been good and that no one has been disadvantaged by the organization, content or execution of the teaching.** All completely agree. Of course ;)
4. **How valuable were the different activities in the course for your learning?**
   - **Lectures**. "somewhat valuable" and "very valuable" fifty fifty.
   - **Exercises**. Two students voted "invaluable" and other four voted "very valuable". The comments from the students also said that the exercises are super useful. 
   - **Project works**. Most students are very positive of the project works, while only one found it "somewhat valuable".
   - **Seminars**. Most students voted "somewhat useful". This means that we should definitely improve the seminar course next year.
   - **Lecture notes**. Two voted "invaluable" while five voted "very valuable". Very useful it is then.
5. **Did you attend the seminar courses? How useful were they to you?** 
   - **Differential geometry for continuous-time stochastic filtering: the projection filter, Muhammad Emzir**. A lot of students do not find it useful.
   - **SDEs and Markov chain Monte Carlo, Cagatay Yildiz**. Three voted useful.
   - **Probabilistic numerics for ordinary differential equations, Nathanael Bosch**. Two voted "valuable" and "somewhat valuable". Most students did not attend. 
   - **Compiled and differentiable scientific computing with JAX, Zheng Zhao**. Three voted "valuable" and one voted "somewhat valuable".
   - **Constructions of Wiener processes, Zheng Zhao**. I originally though this may have the lowest usefulness, while all three voted "valuable".
   - **Gaussian process SDE models, Roland Hostettler**. Five "valuable" and one "somewhat valuable".
6. **Did you experience a mismatch between the prerequisites of this course and what you have learned from previous courses?** Six out of seven found no mismatch, while one found slightly mismatch, meaning that the course's prerequisites are in a good level.
7. **How well does this course fit in your degree program – did it help you obtain knowledge you expect from your degree program?** No students found it a bad fit.
8. **What do you think were the best thing(s) about this course? Description: Here, you can highlight efforts, characteristics or parts of the course you thought were good.** No statistics provided. Please see the PDF.
9. **Please provide constructive suggestions for course development. Description: With your help, the course can be made better, and something that is already good can be made even more prominent/effective.** No statistics provided. Please see the PDF.
10. **Overall, I am satisfied with this course. Description: Here you are asked how well you think the course worked in relation to everything from teacher, content, forms of instruction, and examination to scheduling.** All students agree to a very high extent.

Text comments from the students:

  - The good thing was that it was possible to put in more effort to get more out of it. Generally, I wanted to solve (and solved) more of the assignments than was required. A possibility for the next occasion is to keep the ’give it an honest try and get full points’ for each assignment, but to require a few more points. (On the other hand, I personally enjoyed the greater freedom to explore the material where I wanted, so not a trivial solution here)
  - But then, as stated above, I put some extra effort into solving (but not necessarily presenting) the assignments, pretty much based on the expected credit workload.
  - As is a typical drawback of the lecture format, it could at times be a bit passive (although the python examples in class were very useful). Perhaps a flipped classroom style would do well here: present the lecture material ’off-site’ and work hands-on on the python code examples in class (or something like this)
  - Assignments were very nice to work with and to learn from. The freedom of the final project made it possible to try my wings and learn a lot as well.
  - It would be nice if the lecture notes were typed in LaTeX.
  - Feels like I learnt a lot, and that I now a good foundation to stand on! Well done, I certainly believe this to course to be useful to many students in the future.

# Conclusions and action points for the next year

Based on the feedbacks from the students, we conclude that our course organised for 2022 winter in Uppsala University is successful. To improve the course, we summarise the following action points.

- A lot of students did not actively attend the lectures. I am not sure how to solve this, since PhD students are busy. 
- Improve the lecture presentation. We also need to find a better lecture room, so that we can use blackboard and screening at the same time.
- Some students complained about the hand-written lecture notes. We should next try to typeset the lecture note in LaTeX.
- Change the way of getting the credits for the seminar courses. In this year, students can get the credits if they can select 5 out of the 6 lectures and then solve their assignments. However, we found that the topics of these lectures are too broad, while the students are specialised, hence, the students felt reluctant to do the seminar assignments. We can fix this problem by changing the passing rule. For instance, students can get 9 credit, if they can select **one** of seminar lectures, and then do a **project work** of the selected seminar lecture. 
- Make the exercises a pinch harder. Basically, the students can already find the answers in the companion codes of the lectures, maybe we should not let this be so obvious.
