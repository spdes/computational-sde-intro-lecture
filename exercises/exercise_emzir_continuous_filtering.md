# Exercise on "Differential geometry for continuous-time stochastic filtering: the projection filter"

Write a one-page essay that reflects what you have learnt from the lecture. You are free to define the "reflection" by yourself. Examples of such are, for instance, 1) a summary of how to apply the differential geometry approach for solving the continuous-time filtering problem. 2) how is the projection filtering compared to the conventional Gaussian approximate filtering (e.g., extenden Kalman filter). 3) a feedback to the lecture.
