# Exercise on "SDEs and Markov chain Monte Carlo"

As your course assignment, we ask you to write a one-page “reflections” essay. In a nutshell, you are expected to comment on the presented material. In general, what did you (not) like and why? How do you think optimisation and MCMC are related? How can we bring ideas from one field to the other? In what settings one MCMC method would be more advantageous over the others? What could be the practical benefits of the temperature trick? What metrics other than Fisher information matrix can we consider? Why would one prefer HMC inference over Gaussian processes or variational inference? What potential drawbacks does the presented “complete recipe” have? Feel free to answer some of these or come up with your own questions!
